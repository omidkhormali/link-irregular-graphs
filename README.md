# SageMath Code for Link-Irregular Graphs

This repository contains SageMath scripts used to study and visualize **link-irregular graphs**, including counterexamples to conjectures, custom plotting routines, and algorithms to test link-irregularity in regular graphs.

### Features
- Detection of link-irregular graphs
- Visualization of neighborhood (link) subgraphs
- Code to generate link-irregular graphs and check for structural properties
- Exportable, high-quality graph figures for papers

### Getting Started
To run these scripts, use a SageMath environment such as:
- [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/)
- A local installation of SageMath

All figures generated are suitable for academic papers and reproducible using the provided code.

### License
This project is open-source and free to use for academic and educational purposes.
